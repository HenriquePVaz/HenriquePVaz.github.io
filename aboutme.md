## Hi, I’m Henrique Porto Vaz

I’m a 20-year-old junior at **Michigan State University**, currently pursuing a degree in **Computer Engineering**. Originally from Brazil, I bring a multicultural mindset and a passion for practical innovation to everything I do — whether I’m coding a mobile app or collaborating on a team project.

This summer, I took initiative and built a chore management app designed to help families divide household responsibilities more fairly. It was an opportunity to apply both my technical skills and my deep understanding of user needs — shaped in part by my experiences working in customer-facing roles.

I’ve worked as a **barista at Bean & Benny** and a **food runner at Top Golf**, where I developed strong **customer service**, **time management**, and **team collaboration** skills. These experiences taught me how to stay organized, listen actively, and deliver value — even under pressure.

Outside the classroom, I’ve played **chess** since the age of six, which has trained me in **strategic and logical thinking**. I also played **soccer at a major club in Brazil**, where I honed my sense of **leadership**, **teamwork**, and perseverance.

Fluent in **Portuguese**, **English**, and **Spanish**, I thrive in diverse teams and global settings. My journey has been shaped by adaptability, initiative, and a constant drive to grow — both as a person and as a future engineer.

Let’s build something that matters.
